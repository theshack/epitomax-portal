This branch is the user kiosk for the office locations. Deployable instructions will be added soon.

This project uses Sass and Compass. [Learn how to set those up here](http://thesassway.com/beginner/getting-started-with-sass-and-compass).

To customize this page for other accounts, change the company ID value, which you get from the Epitomax Patient Portal signup URL.

Example:

```
http://my.epitomax.net/PatientPortal/signup.jsp?company_id=COMPANYID&case_no=CASENUMBER
```

The company ID value is stored in /assets/js/main.js under the variable `companyId`.
