# Epitomax Login Kiosk

This branch is the user kiosk for the office locations. Deployable instructions will be added soon.

This project uses Sass and Compass. (Learn how to set those up here.)[http://thesassway.com/beginner/getting-started-with-sass-and-compass].

To customize this page for other accounts, change the company ID value, which you get from the Epitomax Patient Portal signup URL.

Example:

```
http://my.epitomax.net/PatientPortal/signup.jsp?company_id=COMPANYID&case_no=CASENUMBER
```

The company ID value is stored in /assets/js/main.js under the variable `companyId`.

# TODO

- Make Client ID Number required
